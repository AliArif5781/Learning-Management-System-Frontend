/* 
Here’s a summary of your **today’s progress** based on what we worked on:

---

### **Frontend**

* Implemented a **comment like button** using React/Redux Toolkit (`ShowAllComments.tsx`).
* Used `createAsyncThunk` (`courseLikeThunk`) to send like requests to backend.
* Displayed **like count** next to the like button.
* Updated **UI instantly** when a user likes/unlikes a comment.
* Handled **toggle like** (like → unlike → like) for the same user.
* Fixed **avatar/comment user info disappearing** issue by properly populating `user` in backend.
* Managed **state for likes** using local state (`useState`) and Redux.

---

### **Backend**

* Updated `course.service.ts` to **toggle likes** on comments.
* Used `mongoose.Types.ObjectId` to fix TypeScript errors when pushing string IDs into ObjectId arrays.
* Populated **comment owner** and **users who liked** for frontend display.
* Returned **comment with likes and count** to frontend.
* Ensured **duplicate likes are prevented** using toggle logic instead of `$addToSet`.
* Improved **error handling** for missing comments.

---

### **MongoDB**

* Updated `comment.schema.ts` to store `likes` as **array of ObjectId references** to `User`.
* Ensured proper **ObjectId conversion** when adding/removing likes.
* Populated related fields (`user` and `likes`) for frontend display.
* Counted **likes using `likes.length`** after populating users.

---

If you want, I can also make a **visual diagram showing the like flow** from frontend → backend → MongoDB so it’s easier to review. Do you want me to do that?
